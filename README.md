# Hungry hippos but hippos are duck, hedgehog, dog and hamster

## Description
This project aimed to develop a simple game in Python using the Pygame library. The game was inspired by the popular game "Hungry Hungry Hippos" and aimed to demonstrate the usage of threads and critical sections.

## Interface and gameplay
Unlike the original game, in our version pets are divided into two groups. This simplification was made to make game more comfortable while playing on one device. Each team has its eating range, it is one field next to certain pets (see *Image 2* below). There is an apple and a poison, both objects are appearing in random place on the board. Eating an apple gives +1 point while eating poison takes 5 points from the team. The game ends when a team has score below 0. To catch (eat) an object simply press "H" or "D" (H - hedgehog, D - duck) on your keyboard when object is in your range.
